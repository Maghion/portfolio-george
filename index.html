                    A long, long time ago during the age of flip phones and emo rock and *ahem* limewire, there existed a website that dominated the social media scene. That particular site is where my career as a developer began. Back then, MySpace was the site to be and all of our friends and friend’s mothers was on that site. My presence started off as being disgruntled about the lack of layouts that caught my attention to make my page stand out so I took a random pre-existing layout and learned how to modify it to better suit my needs.  At that time, I did not know what HTML and CSS was but I knew how to alter it and eventually made my own layouts from scratch. I posted these layouts and soon found myself with about 15,000 followers at my peak asking for code layouts and “w4w” codes. 
                </p>
                <p>Eventually, MySpace tumbled and the great Facebook took over. My little MySpace layouts empire fell and I continued on as a normal teen trying to figure out my path in life. Accepting the fact that there is no real career path for me, I resigned to working multiple jobs to keep afloat but that all changed when I met a kid who was given a terrible hand by life. He deserves a childhood he does not have and it became my mission to adopt him and to give him that childhood he deserves so I revisited the question I have been dodging for so long. What is my career path? Working multiple jobs until I drop dead is fine if it was just me, but now I need to do something to support a six year old. I realized the answer was in web development. The web development scene has drastically changed over the years and learning it is an adventure I will not forget. I am still learning, and I am still looking forward to coding the next big project.</p>
